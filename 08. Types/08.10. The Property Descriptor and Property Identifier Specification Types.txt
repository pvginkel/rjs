8.10 The Property Descriptor and Property Identifier Specification Types
========================================================================

The Property Descriptor type is used to explain the manipulation and reification of named property
attributes. Values of the Property Descriptor type are records composed of named fields where each
field’s name is an attribute name and its value is a corresponding attribute value as specified in
8.6.1. In addition, any field may be present or absent.

Property Descriptor values may be further classified as data property descriptors and accessor
property descriptors based upon the existence or use of certain fields. A data property descriptor
is one that includes any fields named either [[Value]] or [[Writable]]. An accessor property
descriptor is one that includes any fields named either [[Get]] or [[Set]]. Any property descriptor
may have fields named [[Enumerable]] and [[Configurable]]. A Property Descriptor value may not be
both a data property descriptor and an accessor property descriptor; however, it may be neither. A
generic property descriptor is a Property Descriptor value that is neither a data property
descriptor nor an accessor property descriptor. A fully populated property descriptor is one that is
either an accessor property descriptor or a data property descriptor and that has all of the fields
that correspond to the property attributes defined in either 8.6.1 Table 5 or Table 6.

For notational convenience within this specification, an object literal-like syntax can be used to
define a property descriptor value. For example, Property Descriptor {[[Value]]: 42, [[Writable]]:
false, [[Configurable]]: true} defines a data property descriptor. Field name order is not
significant. Any fields that are not explicitly listed are considered to be absent.

In specification text and algorithms, dot notation may be used to refer to a specific field of a
Property Descriptor. For example, if D is a property descriptor then D.[[Value]] is shorthand for
“the field of D named [[Value]]”.

The Property Identifier type is used to associate a property name with a Property Descriptor. Values
of the Property Identifier type are pairs of the form (name, descriptor), where name is a String and
descriptor is a Property Descriptor value.

The following abstract operations are used in this specification to operate upon Property Descriptor
values:

>>>>>CM:GREEN
8.10.1 IsAccessorDescriptor ( Desc )
>>>>>CM:GREEN
====================================

>>>>>CM:GREEN
When the abstract operation IsAccessorDescriptor is called with property descriptor Desc, the
>>>>>CM:GREEN
following steps are taken:

>>>>>CM:GREEN
1.  If Desc is undefined, then return false.
>>>>>CM:GREEN
2.  If both Desc.[[Get]] and Desc.[[Set]] are absent, then return false.
>>>>>CM:GREEN
3.  Return true.

>>>>>CM:GREEN
8.10.2 IsDataDescriptor ( Desc )
>>>>>CM:GREEN
================================

>>>>>CM:GREEN
When the abstract operation IsDataDescriptor is called with property descriptor Desc, the following
>>>>>CM:GREEN
steps are taken:

>>>>>CM:GREEN
1.  If Desc is undefined, then return false.
>>>>>CM:GREEN
2.  If both Desc.[[Value]] and Desc.[[Writable]] are absent, then return false.
>>>>>CM:GREEN
3.  Return true.

>>>>>CM:GREEN
8.10.3 IsGenericDescriptor ( Desc )
>>>>>CM:GREEN
===================================

>>>>>CM:GREEN
When the abstract operation IsGenericDescriptor is called with property descriptor Desc, the
>>>>>CM:GREEN
following steps are taken:

>>>>>CM:GREEN
1.  If Desc is undefined, then return false.
>>>>>CM:GREEN
2.  If IsAccessorDescriptor(Desc) and IsDataDescriptor(Desc) are both false, then return true.
>>>>>CM:GREEN
3.  Return false.

>>>>>CM:GREEN
8.10.4 FromPropertyDescriptor ( Desc )
>>>>>CM:GREEN
======================================

>>>>>CM:GREEN
When the abstract operation FromPropertyDescriptor is called with property descriptor Desc, the
>>>>>CM:GREEN
following steps are taken:

>>>>>CM:GREEN
The following algorithm assumes that Desc is a fully populated Property Descriptor, such as that
>>>>>CM:GREEN
returned from [[GetOwnProperty]] (see 8.12.1).

>>>>>CM:GREEN
1.  If Desc is undefined, then return undefined.
>>>>>CM:GREEN
2.  Let obj be the result of creating a new object as if by the expression new Object() where Object
>>>>>CM:GREEN
    is the standard built-in constructor with that name.
>>>>>CM:GREEN
3.  If IsDataDescriptor(Desc) is true, then
>>>>>CM:GREEN
    1.  Call the [[DefineOwnProperty]] internal method of obj with arguments "value", Property
>>>>>CM:GREEN
        Descriptor {[[Value]]: Desc.[[Value]], [[Writable]]: true, [[Enumerable]]: true,
>>>>>CM:GREEN
        [[Configurable]]: true}, and false.
>>>>>CM:GREEN
    2.  Call the [[DefineOwnProperty]] internal method of obj with arguments "writable", Property
>>>>>CM:GREEN
        Descriptor {[[Value]]: Desc.[[Writable]], [[Writable]]: true, [[Enumerable]]: true,
>>>>>CM:GREEN
        [[Configurable]]: true}, and false.

>>>>>CM:GREEN
4.  Else, IsAccessorDescriptor(Desc) must be true, so
>>>>>CM:GREEN
    1.  Call the [[DefineOwnProperty]] internal method of obj with arguments "get", Property
>>>>>CM:GREEN
        Descriptor {[[Value]]: Desc.[[Get]], [[Writable]]: true, [[Enumerable]]: true,
>>>>>CM:GREEN
        [[Configurable]]: true}, and false.
>>>>>CM:GREEN
    2.  Call the [[DefineOwnProperty]] internal method of obj with arguments "set", Property
>>>>>CM:GREEN
        Descriptor {[[Value]]: Desc.[[Set]], [[Writable]]: true, [[Enumerable]]: true,
>>>>>CM:GREEN
        [[Configurable]]: true}, and false.

>>>>>CM:GREEN
5.  Call the [[DefineOwnProperty]] internal method of obj with arguments "enumerable", Property
>>>>>CM:GREEN
    Descriptor {[[Value]]: Desc.[[Enumerable]], [[Writable]]: true, [[Enumerable]]: true,
>>>>>CM:GREEN
    [[Configurable]]: true}, and false.
>>>>>CM:GREEN
6.  Call the [[DefineOwnProperty]] internal method of obj with arguments "configurable", Property
>>>>>CM:GREEN
    Descriptor {[[Value]]: Desc.[[Configurable]], [[Writable]]: true, [[Enumerable]]: true,
>>>>>CM:GREEN
    [[Configurable]]: true}, and false.
>>>>>CM:GREEN
7.  Return obj.

>>>>>CM:GREEN
8.10.5 ToPropertyDescriptor ( Obj )
>>>>>CM:GREEN
===================================

>>>>>CM:GREEN
When the abstract operation ToPropertyDescriptor is called with object Obj, the following steps are
>>>>>CM:GREEN
taken:

>>>>>CM:GREEN
1.  If Type(Obj) is not Object throw a TypeError exception.
>>>>>CM:GREEN
2.  Let desc be the result of creating a new Property Descriptor that initially has no fields.
>>>>>CM:GREEN
3.  If the result of calling the [[HasProperty]] internal method of Obj with argument "enumerable"
>>>>>CM:GREEN
    is true, then
>>>>>CM:GREEN
    1.  Let enum be the result of calling the [[Get]] internal method of Obj with "enumerable".
>>>>>CM:GREEN
    2.  Set the [[Enumerable]] field of desc to ToBoolean(enum).

>>>>>CM:GREEN
4.  If the result of calling the [[HasProperty]] internal method of Obj with argument "configurable"
>>>>>CM:GREEN
    is true, then
>>>>>CM:GREEN
    1.  Let conf be the result of calling the [[Get]] internal method of Obj with argument
>>>>>CM:GREEN
        "configurable".
>>>>>CM:GREEN
    2.  Set the [[Configurable]] field of desc to ToBoolean(conf).

>>>>>CM:GREEN
5.  If the result of calling the [[HasProperty]] internal method of Obj with argument "value" is
>>>>>CM:GREEN

>>>>>CM:GREEN
        "writable".
>>>>>CM:GREEN
    2.  Set the [[Writable]] field of desc to ToBoolean(writable).

>>>>>CM:GREEN
7.  If the result of calling the [[HasProperty]] internal method of Obj with argument "get" is true,
>>>>>CM:GREEN
    then
>>>>>CM:GREEN
    1.  Let getter be the result of calling the [[Get]] internal method of Obj with argument "get".
>>>>>CM:GREEN
    2.  If IsCallable(getter) is false and getter is not undefined, then throw a TypeError
>>>>>CM:GREEN
        exception.
>>>>>CM:GREEN
    3.  Set the [[Get]] field of desc to getter.

>>>>>CM:GREEN
8.  If the result of calling the [[HasProperty]] internal method of Obj with argument "set" is true,
>>>>>CM:GREEN
    then
>>>>>CM:GREEN
    1.  Let setter be the result of calling the [[Get]] internal method of Obj with argument "set".
>>>>>CM:GREEN
    2.  If IsCallable(setter) is false and setter is not undefined, then throw a TypeError
>>>>>CM:GREEN
        exception.
>>>>>CM:GREEN
    3.  Set the [[Set]] field of desc to setter.

9.  If either desc.[[Get]] or desc.[[Set]] are present, then
    1.  If either desc.[[Value]] or desc.[[Writable]] are present, then throw a TypeError exception.

10. Return desc.
