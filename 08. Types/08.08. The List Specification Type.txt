8.8 The List Specification Type
===============================

The List type is used to explain the evaluation of argument lists (see 11.2.4) in new expressions,
in function calls, and in other algorithms where a simple list of values is needed. Values of the
List type are simply ordered sequences of values. These sequences may be of any length.
