8.9 The Completion Specification Type
=====================================

The Completion type is used to explain the behaviour of statements (break, continue, return and
throw) that perform nonlocal transfers of control. Values of the Completion type are triples of the
form (type, value, target), where type is one of normal, break, continue, return, or throw, value is
any ECMAScript language value or empty, and target is any ECMAScript identifier or empty. If cv is a
completion value then cv.type, cv.value, and cv.target may be used to directly refer to its
constituent values.

The term “abrupt completion” refers to any completion with a type other than normal.
