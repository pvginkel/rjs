8 Types
=======

Algorithms within this specification manipulate values each of which has an associated type. The
possible value types are exactly those defined in this clause. Types are further subclassified into
ECMAScript language types and specification types.

An ECMAScript language type corresponds to values that are directly manipulated by an ECMAScript
programmer using the ECMAScript language. The ECMAScript language types are Undefined, Null,
Boolean, String, Number, and Object.

A specification type corresponds to meta-values that are used within algorithms to describe the
semantics of ECMAScript language constructs and ECMAScript language types. The specification types
are Reference, List, Completion, Property Descriptor, Property Identifier, Lexical Environment, and
Environment Record. Specification type values are specification artefacts that do not necessarily
correspond to any specific entity within an ECMAScript implementation. Specification type values may
be used to describe intermediate results of ECMAScript expression evaluation but such values cannot
be stored as properties of objects or values of ECMAScript language variables.

Within this specification, the notation “Type(x)” is used as shorthand for “the type of x” where
“type” refers to the ECMAScript language and specification types defined in this clause.
