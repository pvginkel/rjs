10.5 Declaration Binding Instantiation
======================================

Every execution context has an associated VariableEnvironment. Variables and functions declared in
ECMAScript code evaluated in an execution context are added as bindings in that
VariableEnvironment’s Environment Record. For function code, parameters are also added as bindings
to that Environment Record.

Which Environment Record is used to bind a declaration and its kind depends upon the type of
ECMAScript code executed by the execution context, but the remainder of the behaviour is generic. On
entering an execution context, bindings are created in the VariableEnvironment as follows using the
caller provided code and, if it is function code, argument List args:

1.  Let env be the environment record component of the running execution context’s
    VariableEnvironment.
2.  If code is eval code, then let configurableBindings be true else let configurableBindings be
    false.
3.  If code is strict mode code, then let strict be true else let strict be false.
4.  If code is function code, then
    1.  Let func be the function whose [[Call]] internal method initiated execution of code. Let
        names be the value of func’s [[FormalParameters]] internal property.
    2.  Let argCount be the number of elements in args.
    3.  Let n be the number 0.
    4.  For each String argName in names, in list order do
        1.  Let n be the current value of n plus 1.
        2.  If n is greater than argCount, let v be undefined otherwise let v be the value of the
            n’th element of args.
        3.  Let argAlreadyDeclared be the result of calling env’s HasBinding concrete method passing
            argName as the argument.
        4.  If argAlreadyDeclared is false, call env’s CreateMutableBinding concrete method passing
            argName as the argument.
        5.  Call env’s SetMutableBinding concrete method passing argName, v, and strict as the
            arguments.

5.  For each FunctionDeclaration f in code, in source text order do
    1.  Let fn be the Identifier in FunctionDeclaration f.
    2.  Let fo be the result of instantiating FunctionDeclaration f as described in Clause 13.
    3.  Let funcAlreadyDeclared be the result of calling env’s HasBinding concrete method passing fn
        as the argument.
    4.  If funcAlreadyDeclared is false, call env’s CreateMutableBinding concrete method passing fn
        and configurableBindings as the arguments.
    5.  Else if env is the environment record component of the global environment then
        1.  Let go be the global object.
        2.  Let existingProp be the resulting of calling the [[GetProperty]] internal method of go
            with argument fn.
        3.  If existingProp .[[Configurable]] is true, then
            1.  Call the [[DefineOwnProperty]] internal method of go, passing fn, Property
                Descriptor {[[Value]]: undefined, [[Writable]]: true, [[Enumerable]]: true ,
                [[Configurable]]: configurableBindings }, and true as arguments.

        4.  Else if IsAccessorDescriptor(existingProp) or existingProp does not have attribute
            values {[[Writable]]: true, [[Enumerable]]: true}, then
            1.  Throw a TypeError exception.

    6.  Call env’s SetMutableBinding concrete method passing fn, fo, and strict as the arguments.

6.  Let argumentsAlreadyDeclared be the result of calling env’s HasBinding concrete method passing
    "arguments" as the argument.
7.  If code is function code and argumentsAlreadyDeclared is false, then
    1.  Let argsObj be the result of calling the abstract operation CreateArgumentsObject (10.6)
        passing func, names, args, env and strict as arguments.
    2.  If strict is true, then
        1.  Call env’s CreateImmutableBinding concrete method passing the String "arguments" as the
            argument.
        2.  Call env’s InitializeImmutableBinding concrete method passing "arguments" and argsObj as
            arguments.

    3.  Else,
        1.  Call env’s CreateMutableBinding concrete method passing the String "arguments" as the
            argument.
        2.  Call env’s SetMutableBinding concrete method passing "arguments", argsObj, and false as
            arguments.

8.  For each VariableDeclaration and VariableDeclarationNoIn d in code, in source text order do
    1.  Let dn be the Identifier in d.
    2.  Let varAlreadyDeclared be the result of calling env’s HasBinding concrete method passing dn
        as the argument.
    3.  If varAlreadyDeclared is false, then
        1.  Call env’s CreateMutableBinding concrete method passing dn and configurableBindings as
            the arguments.
        2.  Call env’s SetMutableBinding concrete method passing dn, undefined, and strict as the
            arguments.
