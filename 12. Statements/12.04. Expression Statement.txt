12.4 Expression Statement
=========================

Syntax
------

ExpressionStatement :

[lookahead ∉ {{, function}] Expression ;

NOTE An ExpressionStatement cannot start with an opening curly brace because that might make it
ambiguous with a Block. Also, an ExpressionStatement cannot start with the function keyword because
that might make it ambiguous with a FunctionDeclaration.

Semantics
---------

The production ExpressionStatement : [lookahead ∉ {{, function}] Expression ; is evaluated as
follows:

1.  Let exprRef be the result of evaluating Expression.
2.  Return (normal, GetValue(exprRef), empty).
