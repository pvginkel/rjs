12.7 The continue Statement
===========================

Syntax
------

ContinueStatement :

continue ;

continue [no LineTerminator here] Identifier ;

Semantics
---------

A program is considered syntactically incorrect if either of the following is true:

-   The program contains a continue statement without the optional Identifier, which is not nested,
    directly or indirectly (but not crossing function boundaries), within an IterationStatement.

-   The program contains a continue statement with the optional Identifier, where Identifier does
    not appear in the label set of an enclosing (but not crossing function boundaries)
    IterationStatement.

A ContinueStatement without an Identifier is evaluated as follows:

1.  Return (continue, empty, empty).

A ContinueStatement with the optional Identifier is evaluated as follows:

1.  Return (continue, empty, Identifier).
