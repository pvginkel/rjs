12.12 Labelled Statements
=========================

Syntax
------

LabelledStatement :

Identifier : Statement

Semantics
---------

A Statement may be prefixed by a label. Labelled statements are only used in conjunction with
labelled break and continue statements. ECMAScript has no goto statement.

An ECMAScript program is considered syntactically incorrect if it contains a LabelledStatement that
is enclosed by a LabelledStatement with the same Identifier as label. This does not apply to labels
appearing within the body of a FunctionDeclaration that is nested, directly or indirectly, within a
labelled statement.

The production Identifier : Statement is evaluated by adding Identifier to the label set of
Statement and then evaluating Statement. If the LabelledStatement itself has a non-empty label set,
these labels are also added to the label set of Statement before evaluating it. If the result of
evaluating Statement is (break, V, L) where L is equal to Identifier, the production results in
(normal, V, empty).

Prior to the evaluation of a LabelledStatement, the contained Statement is regarded as possessing an
empty label set, unless it is an IterationStatement or a SwitchStatement, in which case it is
regarded as possessing a label set consisting of the single element, empty.
