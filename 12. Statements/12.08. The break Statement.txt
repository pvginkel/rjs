12.8 The break Statement
========================

Syntax
------

BreakStatement :

break ;

break [no LineTerminator here] Identifier ;

Semantics
---------

A program is considered syntactically incorrect if either of the following is true:

-   The program contains a break statement without the optional Identifier, which is not nested,
    directly or indirectly (but not crossing function boundaries), within an IterationStatement or a
    SwitchStatement.

-   The program contains a break statement with the optional Identifier, where Identifier does not
    appear in the label set of an enclosing (but not crossing function boundaries) Statement.

A BreakStatement without an Identifier is evaluated as follows:

1.  Return (break, empty, empty).

A BreakStatement with an Identifier is evaluated as follows:

1.  Return (break, empty, Identifier).
