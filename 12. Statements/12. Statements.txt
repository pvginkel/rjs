Semantics
---------

A Statement can be part of a LabelledStatement, which itself can be part of a LabelledStatement, and
so on. The labels introduced this way are collectively referred to as the “current label set” when
describing the semantics of individual statements. A LabelledStatement has no semantic meaning other
than the introduction of a label to a label set. The label set of an IterationStatement or a
SwitchStatement initially contains the single element empty. The label set of any other statement is
initially empty.

The result of evaluating a Statement is always a Completion value.

NOTE Several widely used implementations of ECMAScript are known to support the use of
FunctionDeclaration as a Statement. However there are significant and irreconcilable variations
among the implementations in the semantics applied to such FunctionDeclarations. Because of these
irreconcilable differences, the use of a FunctionDeclaration as a Statement results in code that is
not reliably portable among implementations. It is recommended that ECMAScript implementations
either disallow this usage of FunctionDeclaration or issue a warning when such a usage is
encountered. Future editions of ECMAScript may define alternative portable means for declaring
functions in a Statement context.
