12.15 The debugger statement
============================

Syntax
------

DebuggerStatement :

debugger ;

Semantics
---------

Evaluating the DebuggerStatement production may allow an implementation to cause a breakpoint when
run under a debugger. If a debugger is not present or active this statement has no observable
effect.

The production DebuggerStatement : debugger ; is evaluated as follows:

1.  If an implementation defined debugging facility is available and enabled, then
    1.  Perform an implementation defined debugging action.
    2.  Let result be an implementation defined Completion value.

2.  Else
    1.  Let result be (normal, empty, empty).

3.  Return result.
