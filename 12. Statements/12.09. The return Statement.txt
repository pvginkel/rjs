12.9 The return Statement
=========================

Syntax
------

ReturnStatement :

return ;

return [no LineTerminator here] Expression ;

Semantics
---------

An ECMAScript program is considered syntactically incorrect if it contains a return statement that
is not within a FunctionBody. A return statement causes a function to cease execution and return a
value to the caller. If Expression is omitted, the return value is undefined. Otherwise, the return
value is the value of Expression.

A ReturnStatement is evaluated as follows:

1.  If the Expression is not present, return (return, undefined, empty).
2.  Let exprRef be the result of evaluating Expression.
3.  Return (return, GetValue(exprRef), empty).
