14.1 Directive Prologues and the Use Strict Directive
>>>>>CM:GREEN
=====================================================

>>>>>CM:GREEN
A Directive Prologue is the longest sequence of ExpressionStatement productions occurring as the
>>>>>CM:GREEN
initial SourceElement productions of a Program or FunctionBody and where each ExpressionStatement in
>>>>>CM:GREEN
the sequence consists entirely of a StringLiteral token followed a semicolon. The semicolon may
>>>>>CM:GREEN
appear explicitly or may be inserted by automatic semicolon insertion. A Directive Prologue may be
>>>>>CM:GREEN
an empty sequence.

>>>>>CM:GREEN
A Use Strict Directive is an ExpressionStatement in a Directive Prologue whose StringLiteral is
>>>>>CM:GREEN
either the exact character sequences "use strict" or 'use strict'. A Use Strict Directive may not
>>>>>CM:GREEN
contain an EscapeSequence or LineContinuation.

>>>>>CM:GREEN
A Directive Prologue may contain more than one Use Strict Directive. However, an implementation may
>>>>>CM:GREEN
issue a warning if this occurs.

>>>>>CM:GREEN
NOTE The ExpressionStatement productions of a Directive Prologue are evaluated normally during
>>>>>CM:GREEN
evaluation of the containing SourceElements production. Implementations may define implementation
>>>>>CM:GREEN
specific meanings for ExpressionStatement productions which are not a Use Strict Directive and which
>>>>>CM:GREEN
occur in a Directive Prologue. If an appropriate notification mechanism exists, an implementation
>>>>>CM:GREEN
should issue a warning if it encounters in a Directive Prologue an ExpressionStatement that is not a
>>>>>CM:GREEN
Use Strict Directive or which does not have a meaning defined by the implementation.
