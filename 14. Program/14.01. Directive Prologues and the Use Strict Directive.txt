14.1 Directive Prologues and the Use Strict Directive
=====================================================

A Directive Prologue is the longest sequence of ExpressionStatement productions occurring as the
initial SourceElement productions of a Program or FunctionBody and where each ExpressionStatement in
the sequence consists entirely of a StringLiteral token followed a semicolon. The semicolon may
appear explicitly or may be inserted by automatic semicolon insertion. A Directive Prologue may be
an empty sequence.

either the exact character sequences "use strict" or 'use strict'. A Use Strict Directive may not

contain an EscapeSequence or LineContinuation.

A Directive Prologue may contain more than one Use Strict Directive. However, an implementation may
issue a warning if this occurs.

NOTE The ExpressionStatement productions of a Directive Prologue are evaluated normally during
evaluation of the containing SourceElements production. Implementations may define implementation
specific meanings for ExpressionStatement productions which are not a Use Strict Directive and which
occur in a Directive Prologue. If an appropriate notification mechanism exists, an implementation
should issue a warning if it encounters in a Directive Prologue an ExpressionStatement that is not a
Use Strict Directive or which does not have a meaning defined by the implementation.
