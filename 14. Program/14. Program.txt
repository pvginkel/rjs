Syntax
------

Program :

SourceElements :

SourceElement

SourceElements SourceElement

SourceElement :

Statement

FunctionDeclaration

Semantics
---------

The production Program : SourceElementsopt is evaluated as follows:

1.  The code of this Program is strict mode code if the Directive Prologue (14.1) of its
    SourceElements contains a Use Strict Directive or if any of the conditions of 10.1.1 apply. If
    the code of this Program is strict mode code, SourceElements is evaluated in the following steps
    as strict mode code. Otherwise SourceElements is evaluated in the following steps as non-strict
    mode code.
2.  If SourceElements is not present, return (normal, empty, empty).
3.  Let progCxt be a new execution context for global code as described in 10.4.1.
4.  Let result be the result of evaluating SourceElements.
5.  Exit the execution context progCxt.
6.  Return result.

NOTE The processes for initiating the evaluation of a Program and for dealing with the result of
such an evaluation are defined by an ECMAScript implementation and not by this specification.

The production SourceElements : SourceElements SourceElement is evaluated as follows:

1.  Let headResult be the result of evaluating SourceElements.
2.  If headResult is an abrupt completion, return headResult.
3.  Let tailResult be result of evaluating SourceElement.
4.  If tailResult.value is empty, let V = headResult.value, otherwise let V = tailResult.value.
5.  Return (tailResult.type, V, tailResult.target)

The production SourceElement : Statement is evaluated as follows:

1.  Return the result of evaluating Statement.

The production SourceElement : FunctionDeclaration is evaluated as follows:

1.  Return (normal, empty, empty).
