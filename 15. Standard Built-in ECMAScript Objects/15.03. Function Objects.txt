15.3 Function Objects
=====================

15.3.1 The Function Constructor Called as a Function
====================================================

When Function is called as a function rather than as a constructor, it creates and initialises a new
Function object. Thus the function call Function(…) is equivalent to the object creation expression
new Function(…) with the same arguments.

15.3.1.1 Function (p1, p2, … , pn, body)
========================================

When the Function function is called with some arguments p1, p2, … , pn, body (where n might be 0,
that is, there are no “p” arguments, and where body might also not be provided), the following steps
are taken:

1.  Create and return a new Function object as if the standard built-in constructor Function was
    used in a new expression with the same arguments (15.3.2.1).

15.3.2 The Function Constructor
===============================

When Function is called as part of a new expression, it is a constructor: it initialises the newly
created object.

15.3.2.1 new Function (p1, p2, … , pn, body)
============================================

The last argument specifies the body (executable code) of a function; any preceding arguments
specify formal parameters.

When the Function constructor is called with some arguments p1, p2, … , pn, body (where n might be
0, that is, there are no “p” arguments, and where body might also not be provided), the following
steps are taken:

1.  Let argCount be the total number of arguments passed to this function invocation.
2.  Let P be the empty String.
3.  If argCount = 0, let body be the empty String.
4.  Else if argCount = 1, let body be that argument.
5.  Else, argCount > 1
    1.  Let firstArg be the first argument.
    2.  Let P be ToString(firstArg).
    3.  Let k be 2.
    4.  Repeat, while k < argCount
        1.  Let nextArg be the k’th argument.
        2.  Let P be the result of concatenating the previous value of P, the String "," (a comma),
            and ToString(nextArg).
        3.  Increase k by 1.

    5.  Let body be the k’th argument.

6.  Let body be ToString(body).
7.  If P is not parsable as a FormalParameterListopt then throw a SyntaxError exception.
8.  If body is not parsable as FunctionBody then throw a SyntaxError exception.
9.  If body is strict mode code (see 10.1.1) then let strict be true, else let strict be false.
10. If strict is true, throw any exceptions specified in 13.1 that apply.
11. Return a new Function object created as specified in 13.2 passing P as the
    FormalParameterListopt and body as the FunctionBody. Pass in the Global Environment as the Scope
    parameter and strict as the Strict flag.

A prototype property is automatically created for every function, to provide for the possibility
that the function will be used as a constructor.

NOTE It is permissible but not necessary to have one argument for each formal parameter to be
specified. For example, all three of the following expressions produce the same result:

    new Function("a", "b", "c", "return a+b+c")

    new Function("a, b, c", "return a+b+c")

    new Function("a,b", "c", "return a+b+c")

15.3.3 Properties of the Function Constructor
=============================================

The Function constructor is itself a Function object and its [[Class]] is "Function". The value of
the [[Prototype]] internal property of the Function constructor is the standard built-in Function
prototype object (15.3.4).

The value of the [[Extensible]] internal property of the Function constructor is true.

The Function constructor has the following properties:

15.3.3.1 Function.prototype
===========================

The initial value of Function.prototype is the standard built-in Function prototype object (15.3.4).

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: false, [[Enumerable]]: false, [[Configurable]]:
false }.

>>>>>CM:GREEN
15.3.3.2 Function.length
>>>>>CM:GREEN
========================

>>>>>CM:GREEN
This is a data property with a value of 1. This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: false,
>>>>>CM:GREEN
[[Enumerable]]: false, [[Configurable]]: false }.

15.3.4 Properties of the Function Prototype Object
==================================================

The Function prototype object is itself a Function object (its [[Class]] is "Function") that, when
invoked, accepts any arguments and returns undefined.

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal property of the Function prototype object is the standard
built-in Object prototype object (15.2.4). The initial value of the [[Extensible]] internal property
of the Function prototype object is true.

The Function prototype object does not have a valueOf property of its own; however, it inherits the
valueOf property from the Object prototype Object.

The length property of the Function prototype object is 0.

15.3.4.1 Function.prototype.constructor
=======================================

The initial value of Function.prototype.constructor is the built-in Function constructor.

15.3.4.2 Function.prototype.toString ( )
========================================

An implementation-dependent representation of the function is returned. This representation has the
syntax of a FunctionDeclaration. Note in particular that the use and placement of white space, line
terminators, and semicolons within the representation String is implementation-dependent.

The toString function is not generic; it throws a TypeError exception if its this value is not a
Function object. Therefore, it cannot be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

>>>>>CM:GREEN
The length property of the bind method is 1.

>>>>>CM:GREEN
NOTE Function objects created using Function.prototype.bind do not have a prototype property or the
>>>>>CM:GREEN
[[Code]], [[FormalParameters]], and [[Scope]] internal properties.

15.3.4.5.1 [[Call]]
===================

When the [[Call]] internal method of a function object, F, which was created using the bind function
is called with a this value and a list of arguments ExtraArgs, the following steps are taken:

1.  Let boundArgs be the value of F’s [[BoundArgs]] internal property.
2.  Let boundThis be the value of F’s [[BoundThis]] internal property.
3.  Let target be the value of F’s [[TargetFunction]] internal property.
4.  Let args be a new list containing the same values as the list boundArgs in the same order
    followed by the same values as the list ExtraArgs in the same order.
5.  Return the result of calling the [[Call]] internal method of target providing boundThis as the
    this value and providing args as the arguments.

15.3.4.5.2 [[Construct]]
========================

When the [[Construct]] internal method of a function object, F that was created using the bind
function is called with a list of arguments ExtraArgs, the following steps are taken:

1.  Let target be the value of F’s [[TargetFunction]] internal property.
2.  If target has no [[Construct]] internal method, a TypeError exception is thrown.
3.  Let boundArgs be the value of F’s [[BoundArgs]] internal property.
4.  Let args be a new list containing the same values as the list boundArgs in the same order
    followed by the same values as the list ExtraArgs in the same order.
5.  Return the result of calling the [[Construct]] internal method of target providing args as the
    arguments.

15.3.4.5.3 [[HasInstance]] (V)
==============================

When the [[HasInstance]] internal method of a function object F, that was created using the bind
function is called with argument V, the following steps are taken:

1.  Let target be the value of F’s [[TargetFunction]] internal property.
2.  If target has no [[HasInstance]] internal method, a TypeError exception is thrown.
3.  Return the result of calling the [[HasInstance]] internal method of target providing V as the
    argument.

15.3.5 Properties of Function Instances
=======================================

In addition to the required internal properties, every function instance has a [[Call]] internal
property and in most cases uses a different version of the [[Get]] internal property. Depending on
how they are created (see 8.6.2, 13.2, 15, and 15.3.4.5), function instances may have a
[[HasInstance]] internal property, a [[Scope]] internal property, a [[Construct]] internal property,
a [[FormalParameters]] internal property, a [[Code]] internal property, a [[TargetFunction]]
internal property, a [[BoundThis]] internal property, and a [[BoundArgs]] internal property.

The value of the [[Class]] internal property is “Function”.

Function instances that correspond to strict mode functions (13.2) and function instances created
using the Function.prototype.bind method (15.3.4.5) have properties named “caller” and “arguments”
that throw a TypeError exception. An ECMAScript implementation must not associate any implementation
specific behaviour with accesses of these properties from strict mode function code.

15.3.5.1 length
===============

The value of the length property is an integer that indicates the “typical” number of arguments
expected by the function. However, the language permits the function to be invoked with some other
number of arguments. The behaviour of a function when invoked on a number of arguments other than
the number specified by its length property depends on the function. This property has the
attributes { [[Writable]]: false, [[Enumerable]]: false, [[Configurable]]: false }.

15.3.5.2 prototype
==================

The value of the prototype property is used to initialise the [[Prototype]] internal property of a
newly created object before the Function object is invoked as a constructor for that newly created
object. This property has the attribute { [[Writable]]: true, [[Enumerable]]: false,
[[Configurable]]: false }.

NOTE Function objects created using Function.prototype.bind do not have a prototype property.

>>>>>CM:GREEN
15.3.5.3 [[HasInstance]] (V)
>>>>>CM:GREEN
============================

>>>>>CM:GREEN
Assume F is a Function object.

>>>>>CM:GREEN
When the [[HasInstance]] internal method of F is called with value V, the following steps are taken:

>>>>>CM:GREEN
1.  If V is not an object, return false.
>>>>>CM:GREEN
2.  Let O be the result of calling the [[Get]] internal method of F with property name "prototype".
>>>>>CM:GREEN
3.  If Type(O) is not Object, throw a TypeError exception.
>>>>>CM:GREEN
4.  Repeat
>>>>>CM:GREEN
    1.  Let V be the value of the [[Prototype]] internal property of V.
>>>>>CM:GREEN
    2.  If V is null, return false.
>>>>>CM:GREEN
    3.  If O and V refer to the same object, return true.

>>>>>CM:GREEN
NOTE Function objects created using Function.prototype.bind have a different implementation of
>>>>>CM:GREEN
[[HasInstance]] defined in 15.3.4.5.3.

15.3.5.4 [[Get]] (P)
====================

Function objects use a variation of the [[Get]] internal method used for other native ECMAScript
objects (8.12.3).

Assume F is a Function object. When the [[Get]] internal method of F is called with property name P,
the following steps are taken:

1.  Let v be the result of calling the default [[Get]] internal method (8.12.3) on F passing P as
    the property name argument.
2.  If P is "caller" and v is a strict mode Function object, throw a TypeError exception.
3.  Return v.

NOTE Function objects created using Function.prototype.bind use the default [[Get]] internal method.
