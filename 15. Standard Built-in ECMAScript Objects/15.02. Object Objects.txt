15.2 Object Objects
===================

15.2.1 The Object Constructor Called as a Function
==================================================

When Object is called as a function rather than as a constructor, it performs a type conversion.

15.2.1.1 Object ( [ value ] )
=============================

When the Object function is called with no arguments or with one argument value, the following steps
are taken:

1.  If value is null, undefined or not supplied, create and return a new Object object exactly as if
    the standard built-in Object constructor had been called with the same arguments (15.2.2.1).
2.  Return ToObject(value).

15.2.2 The Object Constructor
=============================

When Object is called as part of a new expression, it is a constructor that may create an object.

15.2.2.1 new Object ( [ value ] )
=================================

When the Object constructor is called with no arguments or with one argument value, the following
steps are taken:

1.  If value is supplied, then
    1.  If Type(value) is Object, then
        1.  If the value is a native ECMAScript object, do not create a new object but simply return
            value.
        2.  If the value is a host object, then actions are taken and a result is returned in an
            implementation-dependent manner that may depend on the host object.

    2.  If Type(value) is String, return ToObject(value).
    3.  If Type(value) is Boolean, return ToObject(value).
    4.  If Type(value) is Number, return ToObject(value).

2.  Assert: The argument value was not supplied or its type was Null or Undefined.
3.  Let obj be a newly created native ECMAScript object.
4.  Set the [[Prototype]] internal property of obj to the standard built-in Object prototype object
    (15.2.4).
5.  Set the [[Class]] internal property of obj to "Object".
6.  Set the [[Extensible]] internal property of obj to true.
7.  Set all the internal methods of obj as specified in 8.12.
8.  Return obj.

15.2.3 Properties of the Object Constructor
===========================================

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal property of the Object constructor is the standard built-in
Function prototype object.

Besides the internal properties and the length property (whose value is 1), the Object constructor
has the following properties:

>>>>>CM:GREEN
15.2.3.1 Object.prototype
>>>>>CM:GREEN
=========================

>>>>>CM:GREEN
The initial value of Object.prototype is the standard built-in Object prototype object (15.2.4).

>>>>>CM:GREEN
This property has the attributes {[[Writable]]: false, [[Enumerable]]: false, [[Configurable]]:
>>>>>CM:GREEN
false }.

15.2.3.2 Object.getPrototypeOf ( O )
====================================

When the getPrototypeOf function is called with argument O, the following steps are taken:

2.  Return the value of the [[Prototype]] internal property of O.

15.2.3.3 Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor ( O, P )
=================================================

When the getOwnPropertyDescriptor function is called, the following steps are taken:

1.  If Type(O) is not Object throw a TypeError exception.
2.  Let name be ToString(P).
3.  Let desc be the result of calling the [[GetOwnProperty]] internal method of O with argument
    name.
4.  Return the result of calling FromPropertyDescriptor(desc) (8.10.4).

15.2.3.4 Object.getOwnPropertyNames ( O )
=========================================

When the getOwnPropertyNames function is called, the following steps are taken:

1.  If Type(O) is not Object throw a TypeError exception.
2.  Let array be the result of creating a new object as if by the expression new Array () where
    Array is the standard built-in constructor with that name.
3.  Let n be 0.
4.  For each named own property P of O
    1.  Let name be the String value that is the name of P.
    2.  Call the [[DefineOwnProperty]] internal method of array with arguments ToString(n), the
        PropertyDescriptor {[[Value]]: name, [[Writable]]: true, [[Enumerable]]: true,
        [[Configurable]]: true}, and false.
    3.  Increment n by 1.

5.  Return array.

NOTE If O is a String instance, the set of own properties processed in step 4 includes the implicit
properties defined in 15.5.5.2 that correspond to character positions within the object’s
[[PrimitiveValue]] String.

15.2.3.5 Object.create ( O [, Properties] )
===========================================

The create function creates a new object with a specified prototype. When the create function is
called, the following steps are taken:

1.  If Type(O) is not Object or Null throw a TypeError exception.
2.  Let obj be the result of creating a new object as if by the expression new Object() where Object
    is the standard built-in constructor with that name
3.  Set the [[Prototype]] internal property of obj to O.
4.  If the argument Properties is present and not undefined, add own properties to obj as if by
    calling the standard built-in function Object.defineProperties with arguments obj and
    Properties.
5.  Return obj.

15.2.3.6 Object.defineProperty ( O, P, Attributes )
===================================================

The defineProperty function is used to add an own property and/or update the attributes of an
existing own property of an object. When the defineProperty function is called, the following steps
are taken:

1.  If Type(O) is not Object throw a TypeError exception.
2.  Let name be ToString(P).
3.  Let desc be the result of calling ToPropertyDescriptor with Attributes as the argument.
4.  Call the [[DefineOwnProperty]] internal method of O with arguments name, desc, and true.
5.  Return O.

15.2.3.7 Object.defineProperties ( O, Properties )
==================================================

The defineProperties function is used to add own properties and/or update the attributes of existing
own properties of an object. When the defineProperties function is called, the following steps are
taken:

1.  If Type(O) is not Object throw a TypeError exception.
2.  Let props be ToObject(Properties).
3.  Let names be an internal list containing the names of each enumerable own property of props.
4.  Let descriptors be an empty internal List.
5.  For each element P of names in list order,
    1.  Let descObj be the result of calling the [[Get]] internal method of props with P as the
        argument.
    2.  Let desc be the result of calling ToPropertyDescriptor with descObj as the argument.
    3.  Append the pair (a two element List) consisting of P and desc to the end of descriptors.

6.  For each pair from descriptors in list order,
    1.  Let P be the first element of pair.
    2.  Let desc be the second element of pair.
    3.  Call the [[DefineOwnProperty]] internal method of O with arguments P, desc, and true.

7.  Return O.

If an implementation defines a specific order of enumeration for the for-in statement, that same
enumeration order must be used to order the list elements in step 3 of this algorithm.

    2.  Increment index by 1.

6.  Return array.

If an implementation defines a specific order of enumeration for the for-in statement, that same
enumeration order must be used in step 5 of this algorithm.

15.2.4 Properties of the Object Prototype Object
================================================

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal property of the Object prototype object is null, the value
of the [[Class]] internal property is "Object", and the initial value of the [[Extensible]] internal
property is true.

15.2.4.1 Object.prototype.constructor
=====================================

The initial value of Object.prototype.constructor is the standard built-in Object constructor.

15.2.4.2 Object.prototype.toString ( )

4.  Return the result of calling the [[Call]] internal method of toString passing O as the this
    value and no arguments.

NOTE 1 This function is provided to give all Objects a generic toLocaleString interface, even though
not all may use it. Currently, Array, Number, and Date provide their own locale-sensitive
toLocaleString methods.

NOTE 2 The first parameter to this function is likely to be used in a future version of this
standard; it is recommended that implementations do not use this parameter position for anything
else.

15.2.4.4 Object.prototype.valueOf ( )
=====================================

When the valueOf method is called, the following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be the result of calling ToObject passing the this value as the argument.
2.  If O is the result of calling the Object constructor with a host object (15.2.2.1), then
    1.  Return either O or another value such as the host object originally passed to the
        constructor. The specific result that is returned is implementation-defined.

3.  Return O.

15.2.4.5 Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty (V)
============================================

When the hasOwnProperty method is called with argument V, the following steps are taken:

1.  Let P be ToString(V).
2.  Let O be the result of calling ToObject passing the this value as the argument.
3.  Let desc be the result of calling the [[GetOwnProperty]] internal method of O passing P as the
    argument.
4.  If desc is undefined, return false.
5.  Return true.

NOTE 1 Unlike [[HasProperty]] (8.12.6), this method does not consider objects in the prototype
chain.

NOTE 2 The ordering of steps 1 and 2 is chosen to ensure that any exception that would have been
thrown by step 1 in previous editions of this specification will continue to be thrown even if the
this value is undefined or null.

15.2.4.6 Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf (V)
===========================================

When the isPrototypeOf method is called with argument V, the following steps are taken:

1.  If V is not an object, return false.
2.  Let O be the result of calling ToObject passing the this value as the argument.
3.  Repeat
    1.  Let V be the value of the [[Prototype]] internal property of V.
    2.  if V is null, return false
    3.  If O and V refer to the same object, return true.

NOTE The ordering of steps 1 and 2 is chosen to preserve the behaviour specified by previous
editions of this specification for the case where V is not an object and the this value is undefined
or null.

NOTE 1 This method does not consider objects in the prototype chain.

NOTE 2 The ordering of steps 1 and 2 is chosen to ensure that any exception that would have been
thrown by step 1 in previous editions of this specification will continue to be thrown even if the
this value is undefined or null.

15.2.5 Properties of Object Instances
=====================================

Object instances have no special properties beyond those inherited from the Object prototype object.
