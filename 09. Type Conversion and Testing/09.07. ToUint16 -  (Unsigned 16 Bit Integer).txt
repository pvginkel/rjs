9.7 ToUint16: (Unsigned 16 Bit Integer)
>>>>>CM:YELLOW
=======================================

>>>>>CM:YELLOW
The abstract operation ToUint16 converts its argument to one of 2^16 integer values in the range 0
>>>>>CM:YELLOW
through 2^16−1, inclusive. This abstract operation functions as follows:

>>>>>CM:YELLOW
1.  Let number be the result of calling ToNumber on the input argument.
>>>>>CM:YELLOW
2.  If number is NaN, +0, −0, +∞, or −∞, return +0.
>>>>>CM:YELLOW
3.  Let posInt be sign(number) × floor(abs(number)).
>>>>>CM:YELLOW
4.  Let int16bit be posInt modulo 2^16; that is, a finite integer value k of Number type with
>>>>>CM:YELLOW
    positive sign and less than 2^16 in magnitude such that the mathematical difference of posInt
>>>>>CM:YELLOW
    and k is mathematically an integer multiple of 2^16.
>>>>>CM:YELLOW
5.  Return int16bit.

>>>>>CM:YELLOW
NOTE Given the above definition of ToUint16:

>>>>>CM:YELLOW
-   The substitution of 2^16 for 2^32 in step 4 is the only difference between ToUint32 and
>>>>>CM:YELLOW
    ToUint16.
>>>>>CM:YELLOW
-   ToUint16 maps −0 to +0.
