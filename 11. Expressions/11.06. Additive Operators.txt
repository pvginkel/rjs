AdditiveExpression :

MultiplicativeExpression

AdditiveExpression + MultiplicativeExpression

AdditiveExpression - MultiplicativeExpression

11.6.1 The Addition operator ( + )
==================================

The addition operator either performs string concatenation or numeric addition.

The production AdditiveExpression : AdditiveExpression + MultiplicativeExpression is evaluated as
follows:

1.  Let lref be the result of evaluating AdditiveExpression.
2.  Let lval be GetValue(lref).
3.  Let rref be the result of evaluating MultiplicativeExpression.
4.  Let rval be GetValue(rref).
5.  Let lprim be ToPrimitive(lval).
6.  Let rprim be ToPrimitive(rval).
7.  If Type(lprim) is String or Type(rprim) is String, then
    1.  Return the String that is the result of concatenating ToString(lprim) followed by
        ToString(rprim)

8.  Return the result of applying the addition operation to ToNumber(lprim) and ToNumber(rprim). See
    the Note below 11.6.3.

NOTE 1 No hint is provided in the calls to ToPrimitive in steps 5 and 6. All native ECMAScript
objects except Date objects handle the absence of a hint as if the hint Number were given; Date
objects handle the absence of a hint as if the hint String were given. Host objects may handle the
absence of a hint in some other manner.

NOTE 2 Step 7 differs from step 3 of the comparison algorithm for the relational operators (11.8.5),
by using the logical-or operation instead of the logical-and operation.

11.6.2 The Subtraction Operator ( - )
=====================================

The production AdditiveExpression : AdditiveExpression - MultiplicativeExpression is evaluated as
follows:

1.  Let lref be the result of evaluating AdditiveExpression.
2.  Let lval be GetValue(lref).
3.  Let rref be the result of evaluating MultiplicativeExpression.
4.  Let rval be GetValue(rref).
5.  Let lnum be ToNumber(lval).
6.  Let rnum be ToNumber(rval).
7.  Return the result of applying the subtraction operation to lnum and rnum. See the note below
    11.6.3.

11.6.3 Applying the Additive Operators to Numbers
=================================================

The + operator performs addition when applied to two operands of numeric type, producing the sum of
the operands. The - operator performs subtraction, producing the difference of two numeric operands.

Addition is a commutative operation, but not always associative.

The result of an addition is determined using the rules of IEEE 754 binary double-precision
arithmetic:

-   If either operand is NaN, the result is NaN.

-   The sum of two infinities of opposite sign is NaN.

-   The sum of two infinities of the same sign is the infinity of that sign.

-   The sum of an infinity and a finite value is equal to the infinite operand.

-   The sum of two negative zeroes is −0. The sum of two positive zeroes, or of two zeroes of
    opposite sign, is +0.

-   The sum of a zero and a nonzero finite value is equal to the nonzero operand.

-   The sum of two nonzero finite values of the same magnitude and opposite sign is +0.

-   In the remaining cases, where neither an infinity, nor a zero, nor NaN is involved, and the
    operands have the same sign or have different magnitudes, the sum is computed and rounded to the
    nearest representable value using IEEE 754 round-to-nearest mode. If the magnitude is too large
    to represent, the operation overflows and the result is then an infinity of appropriate sign.
    The ECMAScript language requires support of gradual underflow as defined by IEEE 754.

The - operator performs subtraction when applied to two operands of numeric type, producing the
difference of its operands; the left operand is the minuend and the right operand is the subtrahend.
Given numeric operands a and b, it is always the case that a–b produces the same result as a +(–b).
