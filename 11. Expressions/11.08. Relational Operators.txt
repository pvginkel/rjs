11.8 Relational Operators
=========================

Syntax
------

RelationalExpression :

ShiftExpression

RelationalExpression < ShiftExpression

RelationalExpression > ShiftExpression

RelationalExpression <= ShiftExpression

RelationalExpression >= ShiftExpression

RelationalExpression instanceof ShiftExpression

RelationalExpression in ShiftExpression

RelationalExpressionNoIn :

ShiftExpression

RelationalExpressionNoIn < ShiftExpression

RelationalExpressionNoIn > ShiftExpression

RelationalExpressionNoIn <= ShiftExpression

RelationalExpressionNoIn >= ShiftExpression

RelationalExpressionNoIn instanceof ShiftExpression

NOTE The “NoIn” variants are needed to avoid confusing the in operator in a relational expression
with the in operator in a for statement.

Semantics
---------

The result of evaluating a relational operator is always of type Boolean, reflecting whether the
relationship named by the operator holds between its two operands.

The RelationalExpressionNoIn productions are evaluated in the same manner as the
RelationalExpression productions except that the contained RelationalExpressionNoIn is evaluated
instead of the contained RelationalExpression.

11.8.1 The Less-than Operator ( < )
===================================

The production RelationalExpression : RelationalExpression < ShiftExpression is evaluated as
follows:

1.  Let lref be the result of evaluating RelationalExpression.
2.  Let lval be GetValue(lref).
3.  Let rref be the result of evaluating ShiftExpression.
4.  Let rval be GetValue(rref).
5.  Let r be the result of performing abstract relational comparison lval < rval. (see 11.8.5)
6.  If r is undefined, return false. Otherwise, return r.

11.8.2 The Greater-than Operator ( > )
======================================

The production RelationalExpression : RelationalExpression > ShiftExpression is evaluated as
follows:

1.  Let lref be the result of evaluating RelationalExpression.
2.  Let lval be GetValue(lref).
3.  Let rref be the result of evaluating ShiftExpression.
4.  Let rval be GetValue(rref).
5.  Let r be the result of performing abstract relational comparison rval < lval with LeftFirst
    equal to false. (see 11.8.5).
6.  If r is undefined, return false. Otherwise, return r.

11.8.3 The Less-than-or-equal Operator ( <= )
=============================================

The production RelationalExpression : RelationalExpression <= ShiftExpression is evaluated as
follows:

1.  Let lref be the result of evaluating RelationalExpression.
2.  Let lval be GetValue(lref).
3.  Let rref be the result of evaluating ShiftExpression.
4.  Let rval be GetValue(rref).
5.  Let r be the result of performing abstract relational comparison rval < lval with LeftFirst
    equal to false. (see 11.8.5).
6.  If r is true or undefined, return false. Otherwise, return true.

11.8.4 The Greater-than-or-equal Operator ( >= )
================================================

The production RelationalExpression : RelationalExpression >= ShiftExpression is evaluated as
follows:

1.  Let lref be the result of evaluating RelationalExpression.
2.  Let lval be GetValue(lref).
3.  Let rref be the result of evaluating ShiftExpression.
4.  Let rval be GetValue(rref).
5.  Let r be the result of performing abstract relational comparison lval < rval. (see 11.8.5)
6.  If r is true or undefined, return false. Otherwise, return true.

11.8.5 The Abstract Relational Comparison Algorithm
===================================================

The comparison x < y, where x and y are values, produces true, false, or undefined (which indicates
that at least one operand is NaN). In addition to x and y the algorithm takes a Boolean flag named
LeftFirst as a parameter. The flag is used to control the order in which operations with potentially
visible side-effects are performed upon x and y. It is necessary because ECMAScript specifies left
to right evaluation of expressions. The default value of LeftFirst is true and indicates that the x
parameter corresponds to an expression that occurs to the left of the y parameter’s corresponding
expression. If LeftFirst is false, the reverse is the case and operations must be performed upon y
before x. Such a comparison is performed as follows:

1.  If the LeftFirst flag is true, then
    1.  Let px be the result of calling ToPrimitive(x, hint Number).
    2.  Let py be the result of calling ToPrimitive(y, hint Number).

2.  Else the order of evaluation needs to be reversed to preserve left to right evaluation
    1.  Let py be the result of calling ToPrimitive(y, hint Number).
    2.  Let px be the result of calling ToPrimitive(x, hint Number).

3.  If it is not the case that both Type(px) is String and Type(py) is String, then
    1.  Let nx be the result of calling ToNumber(px). Because px and py are primitive values
        evaluation order is not important.
    2.  Let ny be the result of calling ToNumber(py).
    3.  If nx is NaN, return undefined.
    4.  If ny is NaN, return undefined.
    5.  If nx and ny are the same Number value, return false.
    6.  If nx is +0 and ny is −0, return false.
    7.  If nx is −0 and ny is +0, return false.
    8.  If nx is +∞, return false.
    9.  If ny is +∞, return true.
    10. If ny is −∞, return false.
    11. If nx is −∞, return true.
    12. If the mathematical value of nx is less than the mathematical value of ny —note that these
        mathematical values are both finite and not both zero—return true. Otherwise, return false.

4.  Else, both px and py are Strings
    1.  If py is a prefix of px, return false. (A String value p is a prefix of String value q if q
        can be the result of concatenating p and some other String r. Note that any String is a
        prefix of itself, because r may be the empty String.)
    2.  If px is a prefix of py, return true.
    3.  Let k be the smallest nonnegative integer such that the character at position k within px is
        different from the character at position k within py. (There must be such a k, for neither
        String is a prefix of the other.)
    4.  Let m be the integer that is the code unit value for the character at position k within px.
    5.  Let n be the integer that is the code unit value for the character at position k within py.
    6.  If m < n, return true. Otherwise, return false.

NOTE 1 Step 3 differs from step 7 in the algorithm for the addition operator + (11.6.1) in using and
instead of or.

NOTE 2 The comparison of Strings uses a simple lexicographic ordering on sequences of code unit
values. There is no attempt to use the more complex, semantically oriented definitions of character
or string equality and collating order defined in the Unicode specification. Therefore String values
that are canonically equal according to the Unicode standard could test as unequal. In effect this
algorithm assumes that both Strings are already in normalised form. Also, note that for strings
containing supplementary characters, lexicographic ordering on sequences of UTF-16 code unit values
differs from that on sequences of code point values.

11.8.6 The instanceof operator
==============================

The production RelationalExpression : RelationalExpression instanceof ShiftExpression is evaluated
as follows:

1.  Let lref be the result of evaluating RelationalExpression.
2.  Let lval be GetValue(lref).
3.  Let rref be the result of evaluating ShiftExpression.
4.  Let rval be GetValue(rref).
5.  If Type(rval) is not Object, throw a TypeError exception.
6.  If rval does not have a [[HasInstance]] internal method, throw a TypeError exception.
7.  Return the result of calling the [[HasInstance]] internal method of rval with argument lval.

11.8.7 The in operator
======================

The production RelationalExpression : RelationalExpression in ShiftExpression is evaluated as
follows:

1.  Let lref be the result of evaluating RelationalExpression.
2.  Let lval be GetValue(lref).
3.  Let rref be the result of evaluating ShiftExpression.
4.  Let rval be GetValue(rref).
5.  If Type(rval) is not Object, throw a TypeError exception.
6.  Return the result of calling the [[HasProperty]] internal method of rval with argument
    ToString(lval).
