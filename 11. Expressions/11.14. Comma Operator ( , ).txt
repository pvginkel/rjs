==========================

Syntax
------

Expression :

AssignmentExpression

Expression , AssignmentExpression

ExpressionNoIn :

AssignmentExpressionNoIn

ExpressionNoIn , AssignmentExpressionNoIn

Semantics
---------

The production Expression : Expression , AssignmentExpression is evaluated as follows:

1.  Let lref be the result of evaluating Expression.
2.  Call GetValue(lref).
3.  Let rref be the result of evaluating AssignmentExpression.
4.  Return GetValue(rref).

The ExpressionNoIn production is evaluated in the same manner as the Expression production except
that the contained ExpressionNoIn and AssignmentExpressionNoIn are evaluated instead of the
contained Expression and AssignmentExpression, respectively.

NOTE GetValue must be called even though its value is not used because it may have observable
side-effects.
