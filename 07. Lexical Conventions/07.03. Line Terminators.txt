7.3 Line Terminators
====================

Like white space characters, line terminator characters are used to improve source text readability
and to separate tokens (indivisible lexical units) from each other. However, unlike white space
characters, line terminators have some influence over the behaviour of the syntactic grammar. In
general, line terminators may occur between any two tokens, but there are a few places where they
are forbidden by the syntactic grammar. Line terminators also affect the process of automatic
semicolon insertion (7.9). A line terminator cannot occur within any token except a StringLiteral.
Line terminators may only occur within a StringLiteral token as part of a LineContinuation.

A line terminator can occur within a MultiLineComment (7.4) but cannot occur within a
SingleLineComment.

Line terminators are included in the set of white space characters that are matched by the \s class
in regular expressions.

The ECMAScript line terminator characters are listed in Table 3.

Table 3 — Line Terminator Characters

  Code Unit Value   Name                  Formal Name
  ----------------- --------------------- -------------
  \u000A            Line Feed             <LF>
  \u000D            Carriage Return       <CR>
  \u2028            Line separator        <LS>
  \u2029            Paragraph separator   <PS>

Only the characters in Table 3 are treated as line terminators. Other new line or line breaking
characters are treated as white space but not as line terminators. The character sequence <CR><LF>
is commonly used as a line terminator. It should be considered a single character for the purpose of
reporting line numbers.
