7.1 Unicode Format-Control Characters
=====================================

The Unicode format-control characters (i.e., the characters in category “Cf” in the Unicode
Character Database such as left-to-right mark or right-to-left mark) are control codes used to
control the formatting of a range of text in the absence of higher-level protocols for this (such as
mark-up languages).

It is useful to allow format-control characters in source text to facilitate editing and display.
All format control characters may be used within comments, and within string literals and regular
expression literals.

<ZWNJ> and <ZWJ> are format-control characters that are used to make necessary distinctions when
forming words or phrases in certain languages. In ECMAScript source text, <ZWNJ> and <ZWJ> may also
be used in an identifier after the first character.

<BOM> is a format-control character used primarily at the start of a text to mark it as Unicode and
to allow detection of the text’s encoding and byte order. <BOM> characters intended for this purpose
can sometimes also appear after the start of a text, for example as a result of concatenating files.
<BOM> characters are treated as white space characters (see 7.2).

The special treatment of certain format-control characters outside of comments, string literals, and
regular expression literals is summarised in Table 1.
