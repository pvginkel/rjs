7.4 Comments
============

Comments can be either single or multi-line. Multi-line comments cannot nest.

Because a single-line comment can contain any character except a LineTerminator character, and
because of the general rule that a token is always as long as possible, a single-line comment always
consists of all characters from the // marker to the end of the line. However, the LineTerminator at
the end of the line is not considered to be part of the single-line comment; it is recognised
separately by the lexical grammar and becomes part of the stream of input elements for the syntactic
grammar. This point is very important, because it implies that the presence or absence of
single-line comments does not affect the process of automatic semicolon insertion (see 7.9).

Comments behave like white space and are discarded except that, if a MultiLineComment contains a
line terminator character, then the entire comment is considered to be a LineTerminator for purposes
of parsing by the syntactic grammar.
